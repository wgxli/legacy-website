  	<h1>Past Teaching Aids</h1>
	<p>In Fall 2017, I taught several lessons to an IB Mathematics HL class in collaboration with my high school math teacher. Below are some of the teaching aids I created during this experience.</p>
	<ul>
	  <li><a href='pages/presentations/mathematical-induction.pdf'>Mathematical Induction (PDF)</a> — Overview of induction.</li>
	  <li><a href='pages/presentations/common-graphs.pdf'>Common Graphs (PDF)</a> — An overview of exponential, logarithmic, and rational functions. Touches upon the visualization of complex exponentials and the structure of the Möbius group.</li>
	  <li><a href='pages/presentations/trig-identities/presentation.html'>Trigonometric Identities</a> — Derivation of multiple-, sum-, and half-angle formulas in three different ways. Features an interactive diagram and some higher-level examples.</li>
	  <li><a href='pages/presentations/set-theory/presentation.html'>Set Theory</a> — Introduction to set theory. Features two interactive diagrams, challenging exercises, and a philosophical discussion.</li>
	</ul>
